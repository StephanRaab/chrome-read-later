**Privacy Policy for Read Later**

**Effective Date: 2024-06-03**

Welcome to the Privacy Policy for the Read Later Chrome Extension ("Read Later", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the use of information for the users ("you", "your") of the Read Later extension. Importantly, we do not collect any personal data from our users.

**1. Information We Use**

a. **Web History**: Read Later accesses the title and URL of the current page you are viewing to enable you to save it for later reading.

b. **User Activity**: The extension captures and restores your scroll position on webpages to enhance your reading experience when you return to them later.

c. **Website Content**: For video content, Read Later tracks and restores video playback positions, allowing for a seamless viewing experience when you return.

d. **Data Storage**: We use Chrome's native Extension API to store your saved pages and settings locally on your device or in the cloud through Chrome's synchronized storage. This data is not accessible by us and remains under your control. For more information, please refer to the Chrome extension storage API documentation here: [Chrome Storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/).

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information mentioned above solely to provide the functionality of the Read Later extension. No personal data is collected, processed, or shared with any third parties.

**3. Open Source and Transparency**

Read Later is an open-source project. You can view and verify the source code on GitHub at [https://github.com/willbchang/chrome-read-later](https://github.com/willbchang/chrome-read-later). You can also inspect the extension code directly through the Chrome browser by right-clicking the extension icon, selecting "Inspect Popup," and navigating to the "Source Panel."

**4. Data Security**

We implement standard security measures to ensure the safety of the data stored by the extension. As no sensitive personal data is collected, your privacy remains protected.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
